  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
     and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
     typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
      containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with 
    desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, 
            the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly 
            called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States,
             and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically 
             American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby 
             union football.[1] 
            These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes".</p>
